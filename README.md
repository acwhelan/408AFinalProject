# PHYS 408 Final Project

2Dand3DElectricFields schowcases monopoles and dipoles in a 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional visualization. I used this Medium Article as a source: https://medium.com/@mathcube7/visualizing-the-electric-field-of-a-dipole-in-python-ca8ddde83c80 

In electricfieldlines.py, I attempt to take the electric_field function I created in the 2-D visualizer and create an ability to add positive and negative charges, and see the resulting fields.
